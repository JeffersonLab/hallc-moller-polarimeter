Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.10
cmake > 2.6
root

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to MolPol>
make


It just needs to be downloaded and for the example, present in the directory
you are running in.  Otherwise, specify it in the macro as in the
exmaple provided in macros/  An example macro will be found in

macros/runexmaple.mac

To run in batch mode, execute with a macro such as:

./MolPol runexample.mac

Ensure that all macros include a /run/initialization command or else they will
not work. 

==== Visualization ===============

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./MolPol

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac


==== Running on iFarm =============
source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh 2.0
